    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      On the left is the canvas where the simulation is rendered. On the right are two GUI panels. The first lists a couple controls for the program. You can add/remove a cell stroke, adjust the brush size, and start the simulation. The second lists the current cells that will be simulated as well as a couple properties that can be edited. The last cell stroke in the list is the current one that will be drawn on the canvas. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the simulation button to toggle the simluation. You can continue to edit the properties of the cells and even add more strokes in real time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The isSolid property will treat the cell stroke as a static object that will not move during the simulation. Density affects whether the fluid should sink below other fluids or not.
